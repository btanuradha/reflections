When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We are in control of the changes, so we will know when to pull the changes from remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks can be used only on GitHub, 
	branches can be on both git and git hub
	clone - we can clone from gitHub to Git and on local machine (git)

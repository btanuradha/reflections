When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We are in control of the changes, so we will know when to pull the changes from remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks can be used only on GitHub, 
	branches can be on both git and git hub
	clone - we can clone from gitHub to Git and on local machine (git)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	we will know that we have the latest copy of the remote in the local machine

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	can collaborate through email. this method is ok for small changes but may not work if there are more collaborators and lot of changes involved.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	
	when you want others to review your code before commiting to the master in remote. this will help collaborate others code.
